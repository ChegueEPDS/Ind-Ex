          <p>
            The ExAI system is currently in the development and testing phase. Its purpose is to provide users with advanced AI-driven functionalities tailored to support daily operations and enhance efficiency. While the system is operational, it is still undergoing refinements based on user feedback to ensure it meets expectations across all use cases.
          </p>
    
          <h3>Current Features (in beta phase):</h3>
    
          <mat-accordion multi="false">
            
            <!-- AI-Driven Assistant -->
            <mat-expansion-panel class="custom-panel">
              <mat-expansion-panel-header>
                <mat-panel-title> AI-Driven Assistant </mat-panel-title>
              </mat-expansion-panel-header>
              <p>
                The system utilizes an AI model extended with a proprietary knowledge base. With basic configuration settings in place, the system's responses can be customized for various use cases to adjust the content, detail, and quality of questions and answers. 
              </p>
              <p>Testing and feedback will be crucial to finalizing its behavior and refining the AI's capabilities.</p>
            </mat-expansion-panel>
    
            <!-- Ex Register -->
            <mat-expansion-panel class="custom-panel">
              <mat-expansion-panel-header>
                <mat-panel-title> Ex Register </mat-panel-title>
              </mat-expansion-panel-header>
              <p>
                This feature recognizes and registers data using AI-enhanced OCR technology, enabling users to extract and save information into a structured table. Users can create and manage equipment lists, define compliance states, and export the Ex Register in XLSX format.
              </p>
              <p>
                The system currently handles cases where multiple Ex markings appear on a dataplate by registering each marking in a separate row.
              </p>
              <p>
                Additionally, users can create sites and projects, defining associated Ex or Non-Ex zones within them. Equipment can be assigned to these zones, allowing for better categorization and management of assets. This structured approach enhances visibility and organization, ensuring a more efficient compliance and documentation process.
              </p>

              <p>
                The XLSX Tool enables fast and efficient comparison of different versions of Excel spreadsheets. Uploaded files are analyzed, and differences are highlighted in multiple formats:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>A detailed Excel sheet that visually marks differences.</li>
                <li>A structured list for quick review.</li>
                <li>A textual summary explaining the modifications.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                This feature is particularly useful for long-term projects where multiple people collaborate on documents, and different versions are created frequently. The comparison process ensures transparency and improves workflow efficiency by clearly identifying changes between versions.

              <p>
                The Object Recognizer is an AI-powered image recognition tool designed to assist logistics and storage departments with real-time product type identification and registration. By analyzing uploaded images, the system aims to streamline inventory management and improve operational efficiency.

              </ul>
              <p>
                The tool requires a **pretrained AI model**, which is must be custom trsined and development for each individual usecase. In its current demo state, full functionality is not yet available. However, users can explore the concept through a **presentation mode**, where images of products placed on a designated base with a predefined background can be uploaded for analysis.
